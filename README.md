## Components Survey (for the MVP or prototype)

1. AIR QUALITY [sensor.](https://robokits.co.in/sensors/ir-distance-sensors/sharp-optical-dust-sensor-gp2y1010au0f-pm2.5-smoke-particle) x2
2. [Differential sensor.](https://robokits.co.in/sensors/force-flex-and-pressure/pressure-sensors-10kpa-mpx10dp)
3. [HVAC circuit.](https://robokits.co.in/power-supply/dc-dc-power-supply/mc105-3-6v-400kv-step-up-high-voltage-generator-boost-module).

## Further tasks (a brief picutre)

1. create the MVP, see if it is feasible, RAW HWARE.
2. If yes, improvise it, do research find optimum components, build an app etc etc.
3. If no, move to diesel generators.

### Timeline 

Get components by Jan end / Feb. 
TEST/build the MVP by 10th FEB, hopefully Ti's component (only the board) will be shipped by then.
Spend 10 days working on the final thing. ...
